## Notes

- I couldn't keep up with the lecture from Tuesday, so I was mostly watching.  After working through the videos, the project just failed so I had to start over.  
- Working with the xib file in the movieDetailsView was awkward.  I ended up redoing that work in the storyboard.
- I wasn't able to put nearly as mush time into this one as I'd like.  I was out on Friday and all weekend.  I'll do better next time.
